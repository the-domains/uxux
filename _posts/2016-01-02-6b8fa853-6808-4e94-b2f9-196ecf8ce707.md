Taylor Swift 'Suffered For Her Art' While Filming 'Out Of The Woods'

This year, the age-old of practice of friendship made headlines, dividing us all.

Why? Because [Taylor Swift][0]was involved. The singer strutted onto the 2015 MTV VMA red carpet in August with [nine female dates][1], parading her girl power and showing women that, yes, we can band together to make each other stronger without being viewed as catty. But it also made others think her move was a cold, calculated decision that took advantage of feminism for the sake of her carefully crafted image. And from there, the internet split.

Her relationships with celebs like Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss and fellow musician Lorde, among many, many, others became the subject of tens of think pieces --- some of them calling out her "[performative feminism][2]," some labeling her escapades with her attractive friends as "exclusive."
